I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University. I got my master's degree in Automotive Engineering at Clemson in 2016. My research focuses on the human-aware autonomous driving algorithms, i.e., how the presence of human drivers can affect or help the autonomous driving systems. The techniques involved in my research are (inverse) reinforcement learning, optimal control, bayesian inference, etc. My anticipated graduation date is May 2022.
