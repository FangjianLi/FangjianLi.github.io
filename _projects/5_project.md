Here are the summary of the projects I did in the course CPSC8430 from Clemson computer science department. 

### 1. Image classification based on DNN and CNN

The DNN and CNN have been built with Tensorflow in order to classfiy the image from MINST dataset. Moreover, the PCA weights analysis, gradient obervation, generalization analysis, and sensitivity analysis has been conducted. The report and codes can be found in my Github [repository](https://github.com/FangjianLi/Deep-learning-Project1-Image-Classification-with-DNN-CNN)
