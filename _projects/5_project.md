Here are the summary of the projects I did in the course CPSC8430 from Clemson computer science department. 

### 1. Image classification based on DNN and CNN

The DNN and CNN have been built with **Tensorflow** in order to classfiy the image from MINST dataset. Moreover, the PCA weights analysis, gradient obervation, generalization analysis, and sensitivity analysis has been conducted. The report and codes can be found in my Github [repository](https://github.com/FangjianLi/Deep-learning-Project1-Image-Classification-with-DNN-CNN)

### 2. Video caption with seq2seq model

In this project, a typical video caption task is fulfilled by [the seq2seq model](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/papers/Venugopalan_Sequence_to_Sequence_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf). Given a short video, the caption can be generated by the seq2seq model, which is built with **Tensorflow**. In addition, the Bahdanau attention and schedule sampling features are also added to improve the performance. The block diagrams have been shown in the following pics. The report and codes can be found in my Github [repository](https://github.com/FangjianLi/Deep-learning-Project2-Video-Captioning-with-seq2seq)
